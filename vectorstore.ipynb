      "There are two separate editions of this game: Minecraft Java Edition, and Bedrock Edition. Java Edition is the original version of the game, starting development back in 2009. This edition can be played on Mac, Windows and Linux. Bedrock Edition was originally Pocket Edition, but has since been ported to different platforms. It is currently supported on Windows 10 and 11, Amazon FireOS and FireTV, Android, iOS, Xbox One, Playstation 4, Nintendo Switch and Samsung Gear VR devices. The Bedrock Edition client is not supported on Linux officially, but Bedrock server software is available.\n",

Your client automatically broadcasts the info about your game on port 4445. It will also listen for TCP connections on which other players join. This TCP listening port is picked at random every time you start Minecraft. This works well if you do not have a firewall. But if your firewall blocks incoming TCP connections, then it is very tricky to allow this random port in.\n",
